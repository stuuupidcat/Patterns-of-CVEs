    pattern: |
      let $MAYBE_UNINIT_VEC = Vec::with_capacity(...);
      ...
      $MAYBE_UNINIT_VEC.set_len(...);
    message: |
      The `Vec::set_len` method is used to set the length of a vector.
      Ensure that the vector `$MAYBE_UNINIT_VEC` is initialized before calling `set_len` or
      will be fully initialized after calling `set_len` to prevent potential
      memory safety issues.
