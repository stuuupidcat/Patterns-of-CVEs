    pattern: |
      let $LEN = $VEC.len();
      let $CAP = $VEC.capacity();
      Vec::from_raw_parts($PTR, $CAP, $LEN);
    message: |
      The `Vec::from_raw_parts` method is used to create a new vector from a
      given raw pointer, length, and capacity. Check the `$LEN` and `$CAP` to
      ensure they are in the correct parameter positions. (The signature is
      `Vec::from_raw_parts(ptr: *mut T, length: usize, capacity: usize) -> Vec<T>`.)
